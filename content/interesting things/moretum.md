ðŸ¥¯ **Ancient Roman Pesto.** Moretum is an herb cheese spread that was consumed by the **ancient romans**. It was typically made by crushing and mixing different herbs, fresh cheese, salt, oil, and vinegar. Nuts could also be added as an optional ingredient. A variant made with pine nuts is considered to be an early precursor of **pesto**. ([wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moretum))

ðŸ“œ **A recipe in a poem.** A recipe can be found in the poem of the same name in the *Appendix Vergiliana*, a collection of Latin poems by Virgil (70-19 BC). The text of the poem describes the mixing of colours into one when the ingredients are crushed into a mortar as _"color est e pluribus unus"_. ([wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_pluribus_unum))

ðŸ’µ **Origins of the United States Motto.** In 1782, the US Congress officially adopted the Great Seal of the United States and its enclosed motto, _E pluribus unum_ (Latin for 'Out of many, one'). It is sometimes speculated that the motto comes from the original "Moretum" poem, which is the first recorded instance of the phrase appearing anywhere.

## Ingredients

- [ ] A good handful of lettuce leaves (I used butter lettuce)
- [ ] A good handful of arugula leaves
- [ ] 10 sprigs of parsley
- [ ] 10 sprigs of cilantro
- [ ] 6 sprigs of mint
- [ ] 6 chives
- [ ] 10 sprigs of thyme
- [ ] Â¾ cup of ricotta cheese
- [ ] 1 tbsp. of red wine vinegar
- [ ] Salt and pepper to taste
- [ ] Olive oil

## Method

1. Rinse the herbs. Remove the thyme leaves from the stems and pull the leafy ends from the parsley and cilantro. 

2. Take all the herbs and put them into a mortar, tearing the lettuce and chives into smaller pieces to fit, if necessary. Crush with a pestle until ground into a paste. 

3. Mix the cheese into the mortar, along with the salt, pepper, and vinegar, and mash until well incorporated. 

4. Scoop theÂ _moretum_Â onto a small plate and pour oil over to serve. Slice a baguette or other crusty bread and spread on a bit ofÂ _moretum_, if you wish.
