# My Work

## What I'm working on right now

I am currently working on [Datapods](https://www.datapods.app/), a startup I co-founded in July 2022. So far, we have received about â‚¬360K in non-dilutive funding. I research data markets and the [value of personal data](articles/what-your-data-is-actually-worth). Sometimes I work on the Datapods app.
